1. Copy and rename the file ./admin/req/_connect.php to ./admin/req/connect.php and configure the BackEnd db connection : ./admin/req/connect.php
2. Copy and rename the file ./req/_connect.php to ./req/connect.php and configure the FrontEnd db Connection : ./req/connect.php
3. Create db using the ./bdd_recrutor_v6_remplie.sql


Problems :
1. Unable to connect on FF.
2. Connection only possible once on Maxthon3
3. Connection to back end working properly only on Chrome but unable to connect to front end
4. Looking into it for further analysis.
